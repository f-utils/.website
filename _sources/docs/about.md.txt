# about

In this documentation we talk about the scope of `f-utils`.

## objetive

`f-utils` is a Python library. Its objective is to create an environment that:
1. __ensures type safety__, even in a dynamically typed language as Python
2. __allow universal constructions__, so that one can apply the same strategy to different contexts.

It is also part of the scope of `f-utils` to provide context based utilities, based on the above premisses, turning the development with Python more fluid and intuitive.

## philosophy

The construction of `f-utils` is strongly endorsed by certain [philosophical principles](philosophy), which subsumes a [systematics](systematics) and are finally [implemented](implementation) in Python. One can say that:

> `f-utils` is about what we call of `f-systems`.

## implementation

The same principles could be applied to construct other flavors of `f-systems`, in different programming languages. In particular, the [implementation](implementation) provided by `f-utils` could be made in any programming language which is:

1. __dynamically typed__, so that the types of the variables are determined at runtime
2. __functional__, so that functions have a type, which allows us have functions whose arguments are (and that returns) other functions
3. __class-based object oriented__, which means that one can define new types in terms of classes
4. __have class level entities__, so that one can define global information inside a class, which is shared across any module that imports that class.

Examples of that languages are __Javascript__ and __Ruby__.
